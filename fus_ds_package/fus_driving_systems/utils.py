    Custom logging formatter that extends the functionality of logging. Formatter to include custom
    log information.

    This formatter calculates the elapsed time since the start of the program and includes it in
    each log message. Additionally, it includes function-related information such as the module,
    function name, and line number. The timestamp of each log record is also included in the
    formatted log message.

    Attributes:
        datefmt (str): The format string for formatting the timestamp in log records.

    Methods:
        format(record): Formats the specified log record by appending custom log information to it.
